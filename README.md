# [Project 2: Automatic File Sorter- Project Overview](https://github.com/Raseena-KP/Automatic_File_Sorter/blob/main/Automatic_File_Sorter.ipynb)
1. This repository hosts a file sorting script designed to organize files within a specified folder based on their file types</br>
2. The primary objective of this script is to provide an efficient solution for decluttering a directory by grouping similar files into distinct folders according to their file extensions</br>
